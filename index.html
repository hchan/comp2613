<H1>Demo Teacher Application</H1>
I am an instructor for a course (comp2613) @ BCIT.<br/>
The sample project I have built is a Teacher/Classroom relationship.<br/>

Basically, you can add or remove teachers, students and add students to a teacher's class<br/>
This application is powered by Swing backed by a H2 DB.<br/>
 Click <a href="comp2613.zip">here</a> to download my application.  After you unzip this application into a suitable folder, "cd" into that directory and run:<br/>
<pre>
java -jar comp2613-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
