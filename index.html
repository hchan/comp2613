<H1>Demo Teacher Application</H1>
I am an instructor for a course (comp2613) @ BCIT.<br/>
The sample project I have built is a Teacher/Classroom relationship.<br/>
<img src="teacherERD.png"/><br/>
Basically, you can add or remove teachers, students and add students to a teacher's class<br/>
This application is powered by Swing backed by a H2 DB.<br/>
If you wish to see the data persisted to H2, open up the local console:
<a href="http://localhost:8082">http://localhost:8082</a> (H2 will start a server for you)<br/>
and login with the following settings:<br/>
<pre>
Generic H2 (Embedded)
org.h2.Driver
jdbc:h2:mem:testdb
blank username and password
</pre>
<hr/>
 Click <a href="comp2613.zip">here</a> to download my application.  After you unzip this application into a suitable folder, "cd" into that directory and run:<br/>
<pre>
java -jar comp2613-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
</pre>
